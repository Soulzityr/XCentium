HOW TO TEST
1. Open XCentium.sln
2. Click the green arrow at the top to run the software.
3. On the page, put in any absolute URL and hit submit.

NOTES
1. Some images show up as error in the carousel. I am unable to debug why.
	I make sure they are absolute image URLs and I can navigate to them
	with the browser, but for some reason they do not open in the carousel.
	Most images work in the carousel.
